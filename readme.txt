With vars you can define name-value associations from the admin.
== Description ==

With vars you can define name-value associations from the admin.

Then, in your content you can insert
`[vars]name[/vars]`
and get _value_ displayed.

Useful if you have a value (a phone number, number of employees) in several pages that can change, so you can change this once from the admin.

It **integrates into TinyMCE** by adding a menu (compatible also with TinyMCE v.5).

You can choose which users can manage vars.
